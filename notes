looks like raindrops could provide people with atomic counters [maybe give an example--they don't need mutexes uh guess...]

system v stuff seems to...maybe be the same as this but...with poor documentation...LOL

slides don't seem to have much...except some syscall stuff, which might have semaphores, which we already have.


https://github.com/knu/ruby-mmap might actually be useful to people...maybe...guy's seems to be like the only one LOL.  some mmaps seems to be just for 'awesome' file access: http://www.ruby-forum.com/topic/99984 apparently windows has its on mmap method/gem [same link] it must be speedy or something, or allow for inserting into a file more easily or something: http://snippets.dzone.com/posts/show/5487

todo: drb example

mention flocking: http://blog.vmfarms.com/2011/03/cross-process-locking-and.html?showComment=1325347639313#c4215938866291365110  also hints that some day we may want to supply access to named semaphores for super-cross process cross language locking LOL

do we support message queues? do we care/want to? http://semanchuk.com/philip/posix_ipc/

mention "one easy way to share memory is just new it up before forking--all of them will have their own private copy of the data, so they can change it, etc"

posix and system v seem to be competitor cross processes [oh and doze is probably different too]

pipe example 

I guess ipc queue's just send back and forth "bytes" of x length...

mem = ProcessShared::SharedMemory.new(:int)  # extends FFI::Pointer -> SharedInt

maybe just instructions on 
Mutex = ProcessShared::Mutex [?]

can we have an array of shared strings? I guess now, since we can just use a marshalled shared memory for the same I guess...or you could have an array of shared memory into which you write strings [maybe a shared marshal array would be helpful then?]

appears multiprocessing's Queue is "just" a queue that uses a pipe for sending data back and forth

maybe also add a pipe helper "get object" "receive object" from this pipe
  monitormixin or just a parameter?A

appears multiprocessing has an option to start a manager "process" for certain objects...so client's can access queue's remotely? huh? does this replace Drb's server thread perhaps? this might be nice as a "don't have to worry about it drb" though I guess...hmm...meh they can just use the parent for it for now...oh wait they can just start it, then fork and close the socket in the parent [?]

maybe manager is a way for Drb to be shared cross machine?
  LODO: an example demo of "use this mutex across machines, too!"

may eventually want a real Pool object so that you can call do_async on it

SynchronizedArrayAccess too...

TODO fake array example LOL

they have an array that allows you to return values that are each A

appears Python's windows support is "load normally, skipping $0 == __FILE__ 's, then call the method" then...calling static methods?

TODO wrapped pipe 
  that is also multi process synchronized LOL indeed scawah otherwise!

http://parallelforkmgr.rubyforge.org  is like our own Pool...
